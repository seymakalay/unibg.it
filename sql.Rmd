## SELECT

L'ordine dei commenti è importante. Puoi memorizzarli facilmente individuando la prima lettera sulla tastiera.

S per SELECT

F per FROM (e J per JOINS viene subito dopo FROM)

W per WHERE

G ​​per GROUP BY

H per HAVING

O per ORDER

Troviamo `SalesAmount`, `WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) > 2010`, e usiamo `ORDER`.

```
SELECT
CustomerKey,
SalesAmount AS [Sales Amount]
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) > 2000
ORDER BY SalesAmount DESC
```


## GROUP BY

Facciamo GROUP BY `CustomerKey`. Assicurati che sotto l'istruzione `SELECT`, digiti la variabile GROUP BY e aggiungi tutte le funzioni che devono essere aggregate (`SUM`,`AVG`,`MIN`,ecc.).

```
SELECT
CustomerKey,
SUM(SalesAmount) AS SalesAmount
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) > 2000
GROUP BY CustomerKey
HAVING SUM(SalesAmount) > 10000
ORDER BY SalesAmount DESC
```
## HAVING

Applichiamo un filtro a GROUP BY utilizzando l'istruzione `HAVING`.

```
SELECT
SalesOrderNumber AS [InvoceNumber],
OrderDate,
SUM(SalesAmount) AS SalesAmount,
SUM(TaxAmt) AS TaxAmt,
SUM(OrderQuantity) AS OrderQuantity,
SUM(SalesAmount) + SUM(TaxAmt) AS InvoceTotal
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE SalesTerritoryKey = 6
--WHERE SalesOrderNumber ='SO43697'
GROUP BY SalesOrderNumber, OrderDate
HAVING SUM(SalesAmount) > 1000
ORDER BY SalesAmount ASC
```

## TOP(10) PERCENT


Applichiamo un filtro a GROUP BY utilizzando l'istruzione `HAVING`. Otteniamo il 10% dei dati utilizzando `TOP(10) PERCENT` e `FETCH`.

```
SELECT   TOP(10) PERCENT
SalesOrderNumber AS [InvoceNumber],
OrderDate,
SUM(SalesAmount) AS SalesAmount,
SUM(TaxAmt) AS TaxAmt,
SUM(OrderQuantity) AS OrderQuantity,
SUM(SalesAmount) + SUM(TaxAmt) AS InvoceTotal
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE SalesTerritoryKey = 6
--WHERE SalesOrderNumber ='SO43697'
GROUP BY SalesOrderNumber, OrderDate
HAVING SUM(SalesAmount) > 1000
ORDER BY SalesAmount ASC
```


```
SELECT  
SalesOrderNumber AS [InvoceNumber],
OrderDate,
SUM(SalesAmount) AS SalesAmount,
SUM(TaxAmt) AS TaxAmt,
SUM(OrderQuantity) AS OrderQuantity,
SUM(SalesAmount) + SUM(TaxAmt) AS InvoceTotal
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE SalesTerritoryKey = 6
--WHERE SalesOrderNumber ='SO43697'
GROUP BY SalesOrderNumber, OrderDate
HAVING SUM(SalesAmount) > 1000
ORDER BY SalesAmount ASC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY -- TOP(10) PERCENT
--OFFSET 2 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY
```


## Date Functions

```
SELECT  
DueDate, ShipDate,
DATEDIFF(DAY,ShipDate,DueDate) AS DAYSINBETWEEN,
DATEDIFF(hour,ShipDate,DueDate) AS HOURSINBETWEEN,
DATEADD(day,10, DueDate)  AS DUEDAYPLUS10DAY,
DATEADD(day,-10, DueDate) AS DUEDAYMINUS10DAY
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE DATENAME(month, OrderDate) = N'December'AND SalesTerritoryKey =1
```

## Column Maniplation 

```
SELECT
EnglishProductName,
EnglishDescription,
CONCAT(EnglishProductName, '-', EnglishDescription),
LEN(EnglishDescription),
UPPER(EnglishProductName),
LOWER(EnglishProductName),
REPLACE(EnglishProductName,'Front', 'bro'),
ProductAlternateKey,
LEFT(ProductAlternateKey,2) AS ProductShort,
LEN(ProductAlternateKey)-3,
RIGHT(ProductAlternateKey, 4),
RIGHT(ProductAlternateKey, LEN(ProductAlternateKey)-3)AS EnglishProductNameReplaced
FROM DimProduct
--WHERE ProductKey = 555
--WHERE Class <> 'H'
--WHERE Class IS NOT NULL
--WHERE(Class <> 'H' OR Class IS NULL) AND [Status] IS NOT NULL
--WHERE(SafetyStockLevel BETWEEN 500 AND 1000) AND [Status] IS NOT NULL
WHERE Color IN(N'Black', N'Silver', N'White')
```

```
SELECT
FirstName,
EmailAddress
FROM DimCustomer
WHERE FirstName LIKE '_R%'
```


## `IF` and `CASE`


```
SELECT
    FirstName,
    IIF(MiddleName IS NULL, 'UNKNOW', MiddleName ),
    ISNULL(MiddleName, 'UNKNOW' ) AS MiddleName2,
    COALESCE(MiddleName, 'UNKNOW' ) AS MiddleName3,
    EmailAddress,
    YearlyIncome,
    IIF(YearlyIncome >50000, 'Above', 'Below') AS IncomeCategory,
    CASE
        WHEN NumberChildrenAtHome = 0 THEN '0'
        WHEN NumberChildrenAtHome =1 THEN '1'
        WHEN NumberChildrenAtHome BETWEEN 2 AND 4 THEN '2-4'
        WHEN NumberChildrenAtHome >= 5 THEN '5+'
        ELSE 'UNKNOWN'
    END AS NumberofChildrenCategory,
    NumberChildrenAtHome AS ActualChildren
FROM DimCustomer
WHERE IIF(YearlyIncome >50000, 'Above', 'Below') = 'Above' 
AND HouseOwnerFlag = 1 AND NumberCarsOwned > 1
```

## `CAST`

Modifica del tipo di dati con `CAST`.

```
SELECT
SalesAmount,
CAST(SalesAmount AS INT) AS SalesAmountCAST,
OrderDate,
CAST(OrderDate AS DATE) AS OrderDateCAST
FROM FactInternetSales
```

## `WHERE` and `HAVING`

Filtraggio con `WHERE` e `HAVING`.

```
SELECT
CONCAT(dc.FirstName, '', dc.LastName) AS CustomerName,
dc.EmailAddress AS EmailAdress,
--dcy.CurrencyName,
SUM(fs.SalesAmount) AS AmountSpent

FROM FactInternetSales AS fs
INNER JOIN  DimCustomer AS dc
ON fs.CustomerKey = dc.CustomerKey
INNER JOIN DimCurrency AS dcy
on fs.CurrencyKey = dcy.CurrencyKey

WHERE dcy.CurrencyName = N'US Dollar' -- IS MUCH FASTER THAN USING HAVING

GROUP BY CONCAT(dc.FirstName, '', dc.LastName), dc.EmailAddress--,dcy.CurrencyName
--HAVING dcy.CurrencyName = N'US Dollar'
ORDER BY AmountSpent DESC
```

## JOINS

```
SELECT

    dpsc.EnglishProductSubcategoryName AS SubCategory,
    SUM(fs.SalesAmount) AS SalesAmount

WHERE dst.SalesTerritoryGroup = N'Europe'
AND de.[Status] = N'Current'

GROUP BY CONCAT(de.FirstName, ' ', de.LastName), de.title, dcy.CurrencyName
ORDER BY EmployeeName, TotalSalesAmount DESC
```

## VIEW

```
CREATE VIEW vwName

## `CUBE` and `ROOLUP`

Per trovare i subtotali e i totali.

```
SELECT

## Percentage of Total

```
